Signals
=======

BE CAREFUL in Beta yet!!

in application layout add, after javascripts include tag :

	<%= activeSignalsJavascript %>

or if you don't want default timeout

	<%= activeSignalsJavascript {:timeActive => XX, :timeInactive => XXXX} %>

After you can send event in your code with :

	SignalEvent.emit(target, paramsevent);


 - Now Signals could use differents backend : Mongoid or ActiveRecord (if you use Mongoid backend you can pass ActiveRecord target, it's not a problem, reverse it's not possible yet)
 - Now it's compatible with Rails 3!!

MORE DOCUMENTATION must be provided later!!!


to configure the plugin you must provide an initializer like this :

*********

SignalsEvent.backend = 'mongoid' # or 'ar' for activerecord
SignalsEvent.default_end_in = 10.seconds # default is 5 minutes if not changed here

require 'lib/signals_lib' #if you provide your own SignalsLib Checker load them here
